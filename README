# Introduction

This Emacs configuration is supposed to work more-or-less out-of-the-box and
have a few nice features that are not given in the default VHDL-mode.

# Installation

# .emacs

```shell
pushd
cd $HOME
ln -s .emacs.d/.emacs
popd
```

## MELPA

MELPA packages need to be installed seperately

## Pymacs

Pymacs needs to be installed seperately as well.
